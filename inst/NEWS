Changes to package DoE.wrapper

The package is currently under intensive development. 
Most features have now been created, but there may still 
be some changes. 
Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome.

04/06/2011, Version 0.8-3
  - added function decode.design for making sure that coding information 
    is available at all times for response surface designs
  - corrected version numbers in NEWS file

31/01/2011, Version 0.8-2
  - made run.no.in.std.order factor with properly ordered levels for bbd.design
    and unblocked version of Dopt.design
    (standard order currently not so useful for blocked designs)

01/09/2010, Version 0.8-1
  - fixed duplicate seealso sections in two help files

10/08/2010, Version 0.8
  - added functions rsmformula and code.design for easy usage of function rsm 
    and its post-processing methods
  - added names to the coding element of bbd designs
  - added a coding element to the design.info attribute of designs of type lhs, 
    in order to support their analysis with the standard second order methods of 
    package rsm
  - clarified documentation of ncenter for ccd.augment 
  - omitted the meshratio quality criterion from lhs objects, 
    because it severely slowed down generation of larger designs
  - modified NEWS file for better viewing with function news()
  Bugfixes:
  - Dopt.design would not always work, because of column number mismatches between 
    design itself and desnum for candidate data sets with extra columns. 

03/04/2010, Version 0.7-1
  - added dependency on DoE.base version 0.10,
    since summary of several design types from DoE.wrapper (especially type Dopt) 
    was not as intended with earlier versions of DoE.base
  - fixed documentation bugs for Dopt.design

26/03/2010, Version 0.7
  - added function Dopt.design for D-optimal designs with or without blocking
    based on functions optFederov and optBlock of package AlgDesign
  - added function Dopt.augment for augmenting various designs with 
    D-optimal additional runs
  - added several variants of designs for computer experiments from 
    package DiceDesign
  - bug fix: creator element of designs created with ccd.design now gives 
    the original call, not interim calls

14/09/2009, Version 0.6-2
  - made all factor names valid R names in all design generating functions
  - bug fix: design.info attribute for blocked Box-Behnken designs 
    did not include the bbreps and wbreps elements, which caused 
    e.g. function summary.design to fail on them; for avoiding unnecessary 
    case distinctions, these elements (always 1) have been added.

07/09/2009, Version 0.6-1
  - updated links in help files to work with R 2.10.0 onwards
  - renamed package help file (typo correction)

25/08/2009, Version 0.6
  - added ncenter element to design.info attribute of bbd designs
  - added block.name element to design.info attribute of ccd designs
    even if the cube portion is not blocked 
  - added test cases to ccd.augment.test.R in order to detect 
    problems related to levels of the design factors
  - added test cases for function qua.design with design functions
    that are not available in package DoE.base

21/08/2009, Version 0.5
  First version on CRAN
