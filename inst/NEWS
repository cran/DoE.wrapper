Changes to package DoE.wrapper

The package is currently under intensive development. 
Most features have now been created, but there may still 
be some changes. 
Suggestions and bug reports are very welcome.

Version 0.7-1, 03/04/2010
- added dependency on DoE.base version 0.10,
  since summary of several design types from DoE.wrapper (especially type Dopt) 
  was not as intended with earlier versions of DoE.base
- fixed documentation bugs for Dopt.design

Version 0.7, 26/03/2010
- added function Dopt.design for D-optimal designs with or without blocking
  based on functions optFederov and optBlock of package AlgDesign
- added function Dopt.augment for augmenting various designs with 
  D-optimal additional runs
- added several variants of designs for computer experiments from 
  package DiceDesign
- bug fix: creator element of designs created with ccd.design now gives 
  the original call, not interim calls

Version 0.6-2, 14/09/2009
- made all factor names valid R names in all design generating functions
- bug fix: design.info attribute for blocked Box-Behnken designs 
  did not include the bbreps and wbreps elements, which caused 
  e.g. function summary.design to fail on them; for avoiding unnecessary 
  case distinctions, these elements (always 1) have been added.

Version 0.6-1, 07/09/2009
- updated links in help files to work with R 2.10.0 onwards
- renamed package help file (typo correction)

Version 0.6, 25/08/2009
- added ncenter element to design.info attribute of bbd designs
- added block.name element to design.info attribute of ccd designs
  even if the cube portion is not blocked 
- added test cases to ccd.augment.test.R in order to detect 
  problems related to levels of the design factors
- added test cases for function qua.design with design functions
  that are not available in package DoE.base

First version on CRAN: 
Version 0.5, 21/08/2009
